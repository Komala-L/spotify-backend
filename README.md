# 🎵 Spotify Backend API

A robust Spotify-inspired backend application built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. This project provides secure authentication, artist management, music management, and album management APIs following modern backend development practices.

## 📖 Overview

This project was built to gain hands-on experience with backend development, authentication, authorization, database relationships, middleware, and REST API design.

The application supports user registration, login/logout functionality, artist-specific actions, music uploads, album creation, and retrieval of music and album data.
